      A Master Class in Neapolitan Pizza Making (Full Breakdown). Recipe as told
      by Vito Iacopelli.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Pizza Dough, recipe above</li>
      <li>Pizza sauce, recipe above</li>
      <li>Fresh mozzarella, cut into equal sized cubes</li>
      <li>Parmesan Cheese</li>
      <li>Fresh Basil</li>
      <li>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Dust your dough ball with some flour and using a small spatula, gently
        lift out the dough into a bowl of flour. Wrap the rest of the dough
        balls so they don't dry out and put them away.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dredge the dough ball in some flour then transfer to your work surface.
        Take the dough ball that is now coated in flour and press out the dough.
        See how Vito does it here.
      </li>
      <li>
        Then spoon the sauce right in the center and gently swirl it out. Grate
        some parmesan on top, followed by mozzarella, basil, and olive oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a pizza peel, transfer the pizza to your oven and bake until the
        crust is golden and the cheese is melted.
      </li>
      <li>
        To finish off the pizza, grate some more parmesan over top, top with
        torn basil, and a drizzle of olive oil.
      </li>
      <li>Slice & serve!</li>
    </ol>
