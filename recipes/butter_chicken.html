      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
      <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 can (14.5 oz) tomato sauce</li>
      <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
      <li>Fresh cilantro, chopped (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, mix together the yogurt, lemon juice, cumin, cinnamon,
        cayenne pepper, black pepper, salt, and grated ginger. Add the chicken
        pieces and stir until coated. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for
        at least 1 hour, or overnight for best results.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large skillet over medium-high heat, melt 2 tablespoons of the
        butter. Add the onion and cook until softened and translucent, about 5
        minutes. Add the garlic and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, until
        fragrant.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the marinated chicken to the skillet and cook until browned on all
        sides, about 5-7 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the tomato sauce and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low and let
        simmer for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate small saucepan, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter
        over low heat. Add the heavy cream and garam masala and stir to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the cream mixture to the skillet with the chicken and tomato sauce.
        Stir well to combine and let simmer for an additional 5-10 minutes,
        until the sauce has thickened.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve the butter chicken over rice, garnished with fresh cilantro if
        desired.
