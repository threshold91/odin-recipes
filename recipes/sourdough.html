    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sourdough bread doesn't have to be complicated to make. Here is simple recipe for delicious sourdough bread, that anyone can make at home</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>400g strong white flour</li>
        <li>5g salt</li>
        <li>230ml water</li>
        <li>160g sourdough starter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the flour to a clean mixing bowl. Mix the salt through the flour. 
            Add the water and sourdough starter to the flour. 
            Combine all the ingredients together to form a rough dough.
        </li>
        <li>Turn the dough out on to a clean surface and knead for approximately 10 minutes or until the windowpane effect has been achieved. 
            The dough should be smooth, soft and elastic.
        </li>
        <li>Return the dough to the mixing bowl, cover with cling film and allow the dough to prove for 4 hours at room temperature. 
            Form the dough in tight round ball
        </li>
        <li>Prepare a proving basket by lightly dusting with flour. 
            Place the dough, seamed side facing up, into the proving basket. 
            Loosely cover the proving basket with a clean tea towel and leave to prove for another 3 - 3½ hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            To bake, preheat your oven to 230°C / 210°C fan assisted (445°F / Gas 8). 
            Flip the Pyrex dish over so the bowl of the Pyrex dish now becomes the lid. Carefully remove the tea towel.
        </li>
        <li>Bake for 25 minutes then remove the lid from the Pyrex dish and continue to bake, uncovered, 
            for a further 25 minutes until a good crust has formed and the loaf sounds hollow when tapped on the base
        </li>
    </ol>
